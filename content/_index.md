This is a photo gallery demo project for Netlify Large Media made with the photos from [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/).

This project has two branches:

* **master:** A photo gallery that _doesn't use_ Netlify Large Media feature. You can go to [README](https://github.com/netlify/netlify-photo-gallery/blob/master/README.md) to see how you can deploy this to your Netlify account and start using Large Media feature.

* **large-media-sample:** A photo gallery that uses Netlify Large Media feature. You can go to a []() folder to see how large media assets are managed with Git. This branch is deployed as [https://netlify-photo-gallery.netlify.com/](https://netlify-photo-gallery.netlify.com/) demo page.
