This is a photo gallery demo project for Netlify Large Media made with the photos from [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/) and Hugo.

You can browse the code for this site on [GitHub](https://github.com/netlify/netlify-photo-gallery/). This project has two branches:

**[master](https://github.com/netlify/netlify-photo-gallery/)**: A photo gallery that _doesn't use_ Netlify Large Media feature. You can go to [README](https://github.com/netlify/netlify-photo-gallery/blob/master/README.md) to see how you can deploy this with your Netlify account and start using Large Media feature.

**[large-media-sample](https://github.com/netlify/netlify-photo-gallery/tree/large-media-sample)**: A photo gallery that uses Netlify Large Media feature. You can go to a [static/images](https://github.com/netlify/netlify-photo-gallery/tree/large-media-sample/static/images) folder to see how large media assets are managed with Git. This branch is deployed as [https://netlify-photo-gallery.netlify.com/](https://netlify-photo-gallery.netlify.com/) demo page.
